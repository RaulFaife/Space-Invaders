# Space-Invaders V1

This space invaders project is to help warm me up to getting back into web development. Since a lot of my experience is in Unity, I decided to work on a game.
With this, I worked on a video tutorial to get the basics however plan to come back to this project down the line to add extra features.

In this project I learned:
-HTML Canvas
-Javascript Velocity's
-Javascript Classes, maps, and EJS6 syntax

Here are some of the results of this project:

### Entire Game:

### Spawning of Enemies:
Enemies will spawn at a random range depending on the framecount of the game.

### Game Over:
When the player is in contact with a shot, the player will explode and the game will run for two more seconds.

### Score System:
The score itself is just a paragraph tag that is being incremented each time a invader is hit.

### Conclusion:
All in all I am proud of this quick project which gave me an idea of how my Unity experience can be translated to javascript and web development as a whole.
In the future I hope to be able to add 3D models with Three.JS and use Express and Node to setup a online leaderboard.
